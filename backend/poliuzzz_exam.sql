These current loops or dipoles contribute to the magnetization of the material and give rise to internal currents known as Ampereian currents.<br />The Ampere\'s law states that the integral of the magnetic field along a closed loop is equal to the current passing through the surface enclosed by the loop. Therefore, if there are internal currents within the material, there must be a magnetic field associated with them.<br />In the given expression for M, there are non-zero values for a, b, and c, indicating the presence of non-zero magnetization components along the x, y, and z directions, respectively. These non-zero components of the magnetization vector lead to the presence of internal Ampereian currents within the material.<br />Therefore, the correct option is (d) are different from zero.</p>',2),(3,'<p>The Lorentz force on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field is given by the formula F = q(v&times;B),</p>\r\n<p>where q is the charge of the particle, v is its velocity, and B is the magnetic field.</p>\r\n<p>Here, we have an electron of charge e moving with a velocity v in a magnetic field B. The force on the</p>\r\n<p>electron due to the magnetic field is F = e(v&times;B). The direction of this force is perpendicular to both v</p>\r\n<p>and B, and hence it acts perpendicular to the motion of the electron.</p>\r\n<p>The electron completes a semicircle of radius R. During this motion, the force F acts perpendicular to</p>\r\n<p>the displacement of the electron, and hence does no work. Therefore, the work done by the Lorentz</p>\r\n<p>force is W = 0 J.</p>',3),(4,'<p>When a dielectric material is introduced into a volume with an electric field, the energy associated</p>\r\n<p>with the field increases due to the polarization of the material. The molecules of the dielectric</p>\r\n<p>material become polarized, creating their own electric field that interacts with the external field. This</p>\r\n<p>leads to a redistribution of charges and an increase in the energy of the system. In contrast, if the</p>\r\n<p>volume is empty or filled with a non-homogeneous dielectric material, the energy associated with the</p>\r\n<p>electric field will be lower. If the volume is empty, there are no charges or charges to be polarized by</p>\r\n<p>the electric field. If the material is non-homogeneous, the polarization will be less effective and may</p>\r\n<p>cancel out in some regions, leading to a lower energy in the system.</p>',4),(5,'<p>The field B(x,y,z)=axi+2byj+4czk satisfies the properties of a vector field, i.e., it is a quantity with both</p>\r\n<p>magnitude and direction defined at every point in space. Therefore, it is possible for such a field to</p>\r\n<p>exist in nature. The values of a, b, and c are constants that indicate the strength and orientation of the</p>\r\n<p>field at any point in space, but they do not affect the possibility of the field existing.</p>',5),(6,'<p>a=b (not sure about this answer)</p>\r\n<p>For the density of magnetization current to be zero, we need vec{M} = vec{0}, which gives the system</p>\r\n<p>of equations</p>\r\n<p>{c-b= 0; a-c = 0; b-a= 0</p>\r\n<p>The only solution to this system is a=b=c. Therefore, we have option (a) a=b</p>',6),(7,'<p>When a dielectric material is placed in an external electric field, the electric dipoles inside the material</p>\r\n<p>align themselves in the direction of the field. This results in the creation of surface polarization</p>\r\n<p>charges. The sum of these polarization charges is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the free</p>\r\n<p>charge on the surface of the dielectric material.</p>\r\n<p>If the dielectric material has a regular shape, such as a sphere or a cube, then the polarization charges</p>\r\n<p>will be symmetrically distributed and their sum will be zero. However, if the object has an irregular</p>\r\n<p>shape, then the distribution of polarization charges may not be symmetric, and their sum may not be</p>\r\n<p>zero. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.</p>',7),(8,'<p>The intensity of a cylindrical wave is given by the equation I(r) = P/4&pi;r^2, where P is the power of the</p>\r\n<p>wave and r is the distance from the source. As the distance r increases, the denominator of the</p>\r\n<p>equation increases, causing the intensity to decrease. The relationship between the intensity and</p>\r\n<p>distance can be expressed as a power law, with the power being -2. This means that the intensity</p>\r\n<p>decreases as 1/r^2, or as l/r^2 if the wavelength of the wave is taken into account. Therefore, option</p>\r\n<p>(b) is the correct answer.</p>',8),(9,'<p>An electric field is electrostatic if it is produced by a fixed distribution of charges that is not changing</p>\r\n<p>over time, which means that the charges are at rest.</p>',9),(10,'<p>The frequency of a harmonic wave is determined by the source and does not change as the wave</p>\r\n<p>passes through different media. However, the speed, wavelength, and wave number of the wave will</p>\r\n<p>change as it passes between two media with different refractive indices.</p>',10),(11,'<p>According to Gauss\'s law, the electric field near the surface of a charged conductor with a uniform</p>\r\n<p>negative surface charge density is perpendicular to the surface and directed inward, i.e.,</p>\r\n<p>perpendicular to the direction of the surface normal, and directed towards the conductor. This</p>\r\n<p>electrostatic field is uniform, and its magnitude is proportional to the surface charge density.</p>',11),(12,'<p>The displacement current density across a capacitor is given by the formula Js = &epsilon;0(dE/dt), where &epsilon;0 is</p>\r\n<p>the permittivity of free space and dE/dt is the rate of change of electric field with time.</p>\r\n<p>In a plain capacitor, the electric field between the plates is uniform, and is given by E = q/&epsilon;0A, where</p>\r\n<p>q is the charge on the plates, A is the area of each plate, and &epsilon;0 is the permittivity of free space.</p>\r\n<p>Differentiating this equation with respect to time, we get dE/dt = (d/dt)(q/&epsilon;0A) = (1/&epsilon;0A)(dq/dt).</p>\r\n<p>Substituting the given expression for q(t) = at + b, we get dq/dt = a.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, dE/dt = (1/&epsilon;0A)(dq/dt) = a/&epsilon;0A.</p>\r\n<p>Substituting this value in the formula for displacement current density, we get Js = &epsilon;0a/S.</p>',12),(13,'<p>The intensity of a spherical wave, also known as the irradiance, is defined as the power per unit area</p>\r\n<p>carried by the wave. As the wave spreads out in all directions from the source, its energy is</p>\r\n<p>distributed over the surface of an expanding sphere with radius r. The surface area of a sphere is</p>\r\n<p>proportional to r2, so the same amount of energy is spread over a larger area as the distance r</p>\r\n<p>increases. Therefore, the intensity of a spherical wave decreases proportionally to 1/r2.</p>',13),(14,'<p>A conservative magnetic field is one that can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential</p>\r\n<p>function. The condition for this is that the curl of the magnetic field must be zero.</p>\r\n<p>Taking the curl of B(x,y,z), we have:</p>\r\n<p>curl(B) = (5c - (-b))i + (a - 5c)j + (-a)k</p>\r\n<p>If this is to be zero, we must have:</p>\r\n<p>5c + b = 0,</p>\r\n<p>a - 5c = 0,</p>\r\n<p>-a = 0</p>\r\n<p>The third equation gives us a=0, but the other two equations cannot hold simultaneously unless b=0</p>\r\n<p>and c=0. Therefore, the magnetic field is conservative only when b=c=0.</p>\r\n<p>However, the question asks whether the field is conservative at all, and the answer is yes. Any vector</p>\r\n<p>field that has zero curl is also conservative, because the curl of the gradient of any scalar function is</p>\r\n<p>always zero. So the magnetic field in question is always conservative.</p>',14),(15,'<p>The given equation represents the magnetic susceptibility (&Chi;m) of the material as a function of</p>\r\n<p>temperature (T) and the applied magnetic field (H).</p>\r\n<p>If the material is diamagnetic, its susceptibility is negative and small. Diamagnetic materials are</p>\r\n<p>weakly repelled by a magnetic field, and their susceptibility does not depend on the strength of the</p>\r\n<p>applied magnetic field.If the material is paramagnetic, its susceptibility is positive and small. Paramagnetic materials are</p>\r\n<p>weakly attracted by a magnetic field, and their susceptibility depends on the strength of the applied</p>\r\n<p>magnetic field.</p>\r\n<p>If the material is ferromagnetic, its susceptibility is significantly positive, and it strongly depends on</p>\r\n<p>the strength of the applied magnetic field. Ferromagnetic materials exhibit magnetic hysteresis,</p>\r\n<p>where the magnetization lags behind the magnetic field and depends on the previous history of the</p>\r\n<p>material.</p>\r\n<p>Based on the given equation, we can conclude that the material is paramagnetic since &Chi;m(T) is a</p>\r\n<p>function of both H and T. Hence, the answer is (b) Paramagnetic.</p>',15),(16,'<p>The continuity equation for current density and charge density is given by:</p>\r\n<p>&part;&rho;/&part;t + &nabla;&middot;j = 0</p>\r\n<p>where &rho; is the charge density and j is the current density.</p>\r\n<p>Taking the divergence of j, we get:</p>\r\n<p>&nabla;&middot;j = &part;(3x2y)/&part;x + &part;(-3xy2)/&part;y + &part;(xyz)/&part;z</p>\r\n<p>&nabla;&middot;j = 3x2 - 3y2 + z</p>\r\n<p>Since there is no information given about the time variation of j or any sources or sinks of charge</p>\r\n<p>density, we assume that the charge density is in steady state, i.e. &part;&rho;/&part;t = 0. Therefore:</p>\r\n<p>&nabla;&middot;j = 0</p>\r\n<p>3x2 - 3y2 + z = 0</p>\r\n<p>This equation defines a surface in 3D space where the charge density must be constant. Therefore,</p>\r\n<p>the answer is (b) &rho; is constant.</p>',16),(17,'<p>The time constant of an RL circuit is given by the expression &tau; = L/R, where L is the inductance and R is</p>\r\n<p>the resistance.</p>\r\n<p>In series connection, the equivalent resistance of the circuit is R1 + R2. Therefore, the time constant</p>\r\n<p>of the circuit is &tau; = L/(R1 + R2). If R2 &gt; R1, then the equivalent resistance of the circuit is smaller, and</p>\r\n<p>thus the time constant is smaller. This means the transients of the circuit will be faster.</p>\r\n<p>In parallel connection, the equivalent resistance of the circuit is given by (R1^{-1} + R2^{-1})^{-1}.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, the time constant of the circuit is &tau; = L/(R1^{-1} + R2^{-1})^{-1}, which can be simplified to &tau;</p>\r\n<p>= L(R1 + R2)/(R1R2). In this case, the time constant depends both on R1 and R2, and there is no clear</p>\r\n<p>advantage in terms of transients.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer.</p>',17),(18,'<p>The capacitance of a capacitor is given by the formula:</p>\r\n<p>C = &epsilon;A/d, where C is the capacitance, &epsilon; is the permittivity of the dielectric material, A is the area of the</p>\r\n<p>plates, and d is the distance between the plates.</p>\r\n<p>When a dielectric material is inserted between the plates of a capacitor, it increases the capacitance</p>\r\n<p>by a factor of &epsilon;. This is because the dielectric material increases the ability of the capacitor to store</p>\r\n<p>energy by reducing the electric field for a given amount of charge. Therefore, with the same charge</p>\r\n<p>on the plates, the distance between the plates decreases, and the capacitance increases.</p>\r\n<p>The electrostatic field between the plates of a capacitor is given by the formula:</p>\r\n<p>E = V/d</p>\r\n<p>where E is the electric field, V is the voltage across the plates, and d is the distance between the</p>\r\n<p>plates. Since the voltage remains constant with the same charge on the plates, the distance between</p>\r\n<p>the plates decreases due to the insertion of the dielectric material, and the electric field decreases.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, the correct answer is (b) the capacitance increases, and the electrostatic field decreases.</p>',18),(19,'<p>Below the critical temperature, iron exhibits spontaneous magnetization, which means that it acts like</p>\r\n<p>a ferromagnet. In this state, the individual magnetic moments of the electrons in the iron atoms align</p>\r\n<p>with each other so that their magnetic fields add together, creating a large and permanent magnetic</p>\r\n<p>field.</p>\r\n<p>Above the critical temperature, however, iron loses its ferromagnetic behavior and becomes</p>\r\n<p>paramagnetic, which means that its magnetic moments align only in the presence of an external</p>\r\n<p>magnetic field.</p>',19),(20,'<p>In an isotropic material, the magnetic induction B is proportional to the magnetic field strength H, and</p>\r\n<p>the constant of proportionality is the permeability &mu; of the material. Therefore, we can write:</p>\r\n<p>B = &mu;HThis means that the magnetic field strength H is always solenoidal (divergence-free), regardless of the</p>\r\n<p>type of magnetic material. The solenoidality of H is a consequence of the divergence-free property of</p>\r\n<p>B, which is a fundamental property of magnetostatics.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, the correct answer is (b) Yes</p>',20),(21,'<p>The correct answer is (d) r-3.</p>\r\n<p>The interaction energy between two electric dipoles r apart is given by the following expression:</p>\r\n<p>U = (1/4&pi;&epsilon;) [(3P₁P₂ cos&theta;)/r3],</p>\r\n<p>where P₁ and P₂ are the magnitudes of the two dipoles, &theta; is the angle between the dipoles, &epsilon; is the</p>\r\n<p>permittivity of the medium.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, the interaction energy between the dipoles varies as the inverse cube of the distance between</p>\r\n<p>them, or r-3</p>',21),(22,'<p>The correct option is (d) are different from zero.</p>\r\n<p>The presence of a magnetization vector M in a material indicates the presence of microscopic current</p>\r\n<p>loops or magnetic dipoles within the material. These current loops or dipoles contribute to the</p>\r\n<p>magnetization of the material and give rise to internal currents known as Ampereian currents.</p>\r\n<p>The Ampere\'s law states that the integral of the magnetic field along a closed loop is equal to the</p>\r\n<p>current passing through the surface enclosed by the loop.

These non-zero</p>\r\n<p>components of the magnetization vector lead to the presence of internal Ampereian currents within</p>\r\n<p>the material.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, the correct option is (d) are different from zero.</p>',22),(23,'<p>The correct option is (d) the polarization P is parallel to the dielectric induction vector D but not to the</p>\r\n<p>electric field E.</p>\r\n<p>In an anisotropic dielectric material, the polarization P induced in the material is not necessarily</p>\r\n<p>parallel to the electric field E applied to the material. The relationship between P and E is given by:</p>\r\n<p>P = &epsilon;0&chi;Ewhere &chi; is the electric susceptibility of the material, &epsilon;0 is the vacuum permittivity, and E is the applied</p>\r\n<p>electric field.</p>\r\n<p>However, the relationship between P and the electric displacement field D is always given by:</p>\r\n<p>D = &epsilon;0E + P</p>\r\n<p>where D is the electric displacement field, which is related to the electric field E and the polarization P.</p>\r\n<p>In an anisotropic dielectric material, the electric susceptibility &chi; can vary with direction, which means</p>\r\n<p>that the polarization P can also vary with direction. Therefore, in general, the polarization P is not</p>\r\n<p>parallel neither to the electric field E nor to the dielectric induction vector D.</p>\r\n<p>However, the dielectric induction vector D is related to the polarization P by:</p>\r\n<p>D = &epsilon;E + P</p>\r\n<p>where &epsilon; is the permittivity of the material. Since &epsilon; is a tensor in anisotropic materials, D may not be</p>\r\n<p>parallel to E. But P is always parallel to D.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, the correct option is (d) the polarization P is parallel to the dielectric induction vector D</p>\r\n<p>but not to the electric field E.</p>',23),(24,'<p>The correct option is (b) When rotB=0.</p>\r\n<p>The vector magnetic field B is solenoidal, which means that its divergence is always zero, i.e. divB = 0.</p>\r\n<p>This is due to the fact that a magnetic monopole does not exist and the magnetic field always forms</p>\r\n<p>closed loops.</p>\r\n<p>The vector magnetic field B is conservative under the condition that its curl is zero, i.e. rotB = 0. This</p>\r\n<p>condition implies that the magnetic flux through any closed loop is zero, which in turn implies that the</p>\r\n<p>line integral of B around any closed loop is also zero. Therefore, the work done by the magnetic field</p>\r\n<p>on a charged particle moving along a closed loop is zero, and the magnetic field does not do any net</p>\r\n<p>work on a particle moving along any path.</p>\r\n<p>The condition rotB=0 is equivalent to the condition that B can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar</p>\r\n<p>potential, i.e. B = -grad&phi;, where &phi; is the magnetic scalar potential. This implies that the work done by</p>\r\n<p>the magnetic field on a charged particle is equal to the negative of the change in the potential energy</p>\r\n<p>of the particle due to its motion.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, the correct option is (b) When rotB=0.</p>',24),(25,'<p>The speed of an electromagnetic wave is given by:</p>\r\n<p>v = &lambda;f</p>\r\n<p>where v is the speed of light (since electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light in vacuum), &lambda; is</p>\r\n<p>the wavelength, and f is the frequency.</p>\r\n<p>Rearranging the above equation, we get:</p>\r\n<p>&lambda; = v/f</p>\r\n<p>Substituting the given values, we get:</p>\r\n<p>&lambda; = (2.7 x 10^8 m/s)/(1.8 x 10^12 Hz) = 1.5 x 10^-4 mTherefore, the value of the wavelength &lambda; is 1.5 x 10^-4 m, which means that the electromagnetic</p>\r\n<p>wave is in the infrared region of the spectrum.</p>\r\n<p>The period T is given by:</p>\r\n<p>T = 1/f</p>\r\n<p>Substituting the given value of frequency f, we get:</p>\r\n<p>T = 1/(1.8 x 10^12 Hz) = 5.55 x 10^-13 s</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, the value of the period T is 5.55 x 10^-13 s.</p>\r\n<p>Hence, the answer is (c)&lambda; = 1.5 x 10^-4 m, T = 5.55 x 10^-13 s</p>',25),(26,'<p>The correct answer is (c) the magnetic field generated at a point P by a moving (non-relativistic)</p>\r\n<p>charge is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charge and the point P.</p>\r\n<p>The magnetic field due to a point charge q moving with a constant velocity v is given by the Biot-</p>\r\n<p>Savart law:</p>\r\n<p>B = (&mu;0/4&pi;) (qv x r) / r3</p>\r\n<p>where r is the displacement vector from the charge to the point P, and v x r is the vector cross product</p>\r\n<p>of the velocity and displacement vectors. &mu;0 is the permeability of free space.</p>\r\n<p>We can simplify this expression for B by writing it in terms of the distance between the charge and</p>\r\n<p>the point P.
